description: 'Configure your `organization.yml`'
---

This file, `organization.yml` represents your AWS Organization. Any changes to `Accounts` or `OrganizationUnits` will be reflected in your AWS Organization. You can create new accounts or organization units, move accounts to different organization units, and assign `Terraform`, `Cloudformation`, `CDK`stacks at **any** level in the hierarchy.

# Structure
Telophase allows you to structure accounts in any way the cloud provider allows. You can nest `Organization Units` within each other.

```yaml
Organization:
    Name: root  ## AWS Organization Root
    OrganizationUnits:  ## Organization Units
        - Name: ProductionTenants
          Stacks:  ## Terraform, Cloudformation and CDK stacks to apply to all accounts in this Organization Unit
            - Path: go/src/cdk
              Type: CDK
              Name: telophase-owner
          Accounts:  ## Accounts at the top level of this Organization Unit
            - Email: ethan+clitest4@telophase.dev
              AccountName: cli-test4
              Tags:
                - "production"
    Accounts:
        - AccountName: Management
          Email: mgmt@telophase.dev
```

# AWS Organization Root
`Organization:` instructs the Telophase parser that an AWS Organization follows. It has no corresponding representation in AWS.
`Name: root` represents the root organization unit in your AWS Organization. It is the parent for all accounts and organization units. It cannot be renamed.

```yaml
Organization:
    Name: root  # (Required) This must be set to "Name: root".
    Accounts:  # (Optional) Child accounts of root Organization Unit.
    OrganizationUnits:  # (Optional) Child Organization Units of the root Organization Unit.
```

# Account
`Accounts` represents a list of AWS `Account`s.

```yaml
Accounts:
  - Email:  # (Required) Email used to create the account. This will be the root user for this account.
    AccountName:  # (Required) Name of the account.
    Tags:  # (Optional) Telophase label for this account. Tags translate to AWS tags with a `=` as the key value delimiter. For example, `telophase:env=prod`
    Stacks:  # (Optional) Terraform, Cloudformation and CDK stacks to apply to all accounts in this Organization Unit.
    State:  # (Optional) Can be set to `deleted` to delete an account. Experimental.
```

## Example
```yaml
Accounts:
  - Email: us-prod@telophase.dev
    AccountName: us-prod
  - Email: eu-prod@telophase.dev
    AccountName: eu-prod
```

This will create two Accounts:
1. `us-prod` with root user `us-prod@telophase.dev`
2. `eu-prod` with root user `eu-prod@telophase.dev`

# OrganizationUnits
`OrganizationUnits` represents a list of AWS `Organization Unit`s.

```yaml
OrganizationUnits:
  - Name:  # (Required) Name of the Organization Unit.
    Accounts:  # (Optional) Child accounts of this Organization Unit.
    Stacks:  # (Optional) Terraform, Cloudformation, and CDK stacks to apply to all accounts in this Organization Unit.
    OrganizationUnits:  # (Optional) Child Organization Units of this Organization Unit.
```

### Example
```yaml
OrganizationUnits:
    - Name: Production
      Accounts:
        - Email: us-prod@telophase.dev
          AccountName: us-prod
        - Email: eu-prod@telophase.dev
          AccountName: eu-prod
    - Name: Dev Accounts
      Accounts:
        - Email: developer1@telophase.dev
          AccountName: developer1
        - Email: developer2@telophase.dev
          AccountName: developer2
```

This will create two OUs:
1. `Production` with child accounts `us-prod` and `eu-prod`
2. `Dev Accounts` with child accounts `developer1` and `developer2`

# Stacks
Terraform, Cloudformation and CDK stacks can be assigned to `Account`s and `OrganizationUnits`s. Stacks assigned to `OrganizationUnits` will be applied to all child `Account`s.

```yaml
Stacks:
  - Path:  # (Required) Path to CDK or Terraform project. This must be a directory.
    Type:  # (Required) "Terraform", "CDK", "Cloudformation .
    Name:  # (Optional) Name of the Stack to filter on with --stacks.
    AssumeRoleName:  # (Optional) Force the stack to use a specific role when applying a stack. The default role is the account's `AssumeRoleName` which is typically the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`.
    Region: # (Optional) What region the stack's resources will be provisioned in. Region can be a comma separated list of regions or "all" to apply to all regions in an account.
    Workspace: # (Optional) Specify a Terraform workspace to use.
    CloudformationParameters: # (Optional) A list of parameters to pass into the cloudformation stack.
```

### Example
```yaml
Accounts:
  - Email: us-prod@telophase.dev
    AccountName: us-prod
    Stacks:
      - Path: go/src/cdk
        Type: CDK
        Name: restrict-us
      - Path: tf/default-vpc
        Type: Terraform
```

This will run two separate applies in the `us-prod` account:
1. `restrict-us` CDK stack in `go/src/cdk`
2. `tf/default-vpc` Terraform stack.

# Tags
Tags can be used to perform operations on groups of accounts. `Account`s and `OrganizationUnits`s can be tagged. Tags represent AWS `Tag`s.
Telophase Tags map to AWS tags with a key, value pair delimited by an `=`. For example, `env=dev` will translate to an AWS tag on an Account or OU with the key `env` and value `dev`.


Telophase commands optionally take tags as inputs, allowing you to limit the scope of the operation. 

### Example
```yaml
 Accounts:
    - Email: newdev+1@telophase.dev
      AccountName: newdev1
      Tags:
        - "env=dev"
    - Email: newdev+2@telophase.dev
      AccountName: newdev2

    - Email: production@telophase.dev
      AccountName: production
```

`telophasecli diff --tag "env=dev"` will show a `diff` for only the `newdev1` account.
