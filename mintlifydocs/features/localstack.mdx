# Example: Localstack
This example will walk you through using localstack with Telophase to create AWS Accounts and OUs (see: [`organization.yml`](./organization.yml)), and deploy CDK and Terraform to them.

# Getting Started with Localstack + Telophase
1. Install Dependencies
```bash
./setup.sh
```

2. Start up Localstack in the background. Ensure your pro license is set. Learn more [here](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/auth-token/)
```bash
localstack start -d
```

3. Localstack Setup
Create your root organization in Localstack
```bash
awslocal organizations create-organization --feature-set ALL
```

4. Setup an AWS_REGION if not set
```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

5. Deploy Infra in the Accounts

Telophase will:
1. Create the accounts and OUs listed in [`organization.yml`](https://github.com/Santiago-Labs/telophasecli/blob/main/examples/localstack/organization.yml)
2. A CDK stack will create an S3 bucket for a terraform state will be create in each account. Additionally, a Terraform stack will create a CI deploy role in each account in the `Production` OU.
```bash
LOCALSTACK=true telophasecli deploy --tui
```

6. Inspect the accounts using `awslocal`

Learn how Localstack handles multi-account auth [here](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/multi-account-setups/)
```bash
# View the organizations you have created
awslocal organizations list-accounts

# Each account will have its own tfstate bucket 
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AN_ORG_FROM_ABOVE awslocal s3 ls

# New roles will be created in each account
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AN_ORG_FROM_ABOVE awslocal iam list-roles
```

### Common Errors
#### Cannot create preexisting table / Cannot do operations on a non-existent table
These are triggered by a concurrency bug in localstack. You can resolve it by pre-creating the `tf-test-state` table and running Telophase again:
```bash
aws dynamodb create-table --table-name tf-test-state \
--attribute-definitions AttributeName=id,AttributeType=S \
--key-schema AttributeName=id,KeyType=HASH \
--provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5 \
--endpoint-url http://localhost:4566

LOCALSTACK=true telophasecli deploy
```
