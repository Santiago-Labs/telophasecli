Terraform and CDK (AWS Only) can be assigned at any level in the hierarchy. All child accounts inherit the stack.

## Example
```yml
Organization:
  OrganizationUnits:
      - Name: Production
        Stacks:
            # This stack will be applied to all accounts in the `Production` OU (`Safety Firmware` and `Safety Ingestion Team`).
          - Name: SCPDisableEURegion 
            Path: go/src/cdk/scp
            Type: CDK
        Accounts:
          - Email: safety+firmware@example.app
            AccountName: Safety Firmware
            Stacks:
                # This stack will be applied to `Safety Firmware` account only.
              - Path: tf/safety/firmware_bucket 
                Type: Terraform
