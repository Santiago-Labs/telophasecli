`telophasecli` allows you to define your AWS Organization Unit structure via code. 

## Example `organization.yml`
```yml
Organization:
  OrganizationUnits:
      - Name: Production
        Accounts:
          - Email: safety+firmware@example.app
            AccountName: Safety Firmware
          - Email: safety+ingestion@example.app
            AccountName: Safety Ingestion Team
      - Name: Development
        Accounts:
          - Email: eng1@example.app
            AccountName: Engineer A

```

The configuration above will create
1) `Production` Organizational Unit
2) `Safety Firmware` and `Safety Ingestion Team` accounts in the `Production` OU
3) `Development` Organizational Unit
4) `Engineer A` account in the `Development` OU

These accounts can be provisioned via `telophasecli account deploy`
