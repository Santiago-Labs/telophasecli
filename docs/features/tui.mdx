Telophase comes with an interactive terminal UI (TUI). Enabled the TUI by passing in the `--tui` flag. For example, `telophasecli deploy --tui`

<img src="/images/tui.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />

The TUI is helpful to organize output across the multiple accounts that are being deployed in parallel.
